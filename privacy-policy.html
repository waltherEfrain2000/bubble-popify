  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App does not collect personal information such as name, address, phone number, or email.

    <li>Improve performance and fix technical issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>The App does not share personal information with third parties. If third-party services such as advertising networks or analytics tools are used, they will operate under their own privacy policies (e.g., Google AdMob, Google Analytics).</p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect user information from unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure. However, please note that no method of data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>
